# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project implements a **machine learning classification model** to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements.

## Project Overview
The Iris Flower Classification problem involves predicting one of three species:
- Iris Setosa  
- Iris Versicolor  
- Iris Virginica  

Based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project highlights how supervised learning algorithms can be applied to structured datasets.
