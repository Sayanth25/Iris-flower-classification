# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project implements a **machine learning classification model** to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements. It uses the classic **Iris dataset**, making it a strong beginner-to-intermediate project for showcasing core **Data Science and ML concepts**.

The project demonstrates the complete workflow of a classification problem, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview
The Iris Flower Classification problem involves predicting one of three species:
- Iris Setosa  
- Iris Versicolor  
- Iris Virginica  

Based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project highlights how supervised learning algorithms can be applied to structured datasets.
